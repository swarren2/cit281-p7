## Project 7

This final project was used as a way of creating GitHub pages in order to access the projects we did over the course of the term in CIT 281. This involved creating repositories and publishing each to a GitHub page as well as linking all the pages on to one page for easy access. This project allows us to document all of our project online in a formatted portfolio. 

Here is an image of the raw formatting for the main page (before the Project 7 page was added):
